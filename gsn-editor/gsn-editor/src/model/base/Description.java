/**
 * Description is used to specify a description that may be associated with a ModelElement. 
 * In many cases Description is used to provide the ‘content’ of a SACM element. For 
 * example, it would be used to provide the text of a Claim.
 * <h1>Semantics</h1>
 * A Description provides details about ModelElements in relation to aspects such as their 
 * content or purpose. Therefore, Descriptions can be used to both characterize 
 * ModelElements and facilitate their understanding.
